# SenseDiscriminate
This repo contains the code and dataset for our paper " Discriminating soft actuators' thermal stimuli and mechanical deformation by hydrogel sensors and machine learning" 

by Shuyu Wang*, Zhaojia Sun et.al

Here, we use two hydrogel sensors for simultaneously proprioceptive, thermoceptive and mechanoceptive sensing. These stretchable sensors show high sensitivity to strain and temperature changes.  Then, we utilize a machine learning model, composed of 1D convolutional neural network and feed-forward neural network, to decode the sensing signal for various stimuli identification. We demonstrate the proposed method can accurately predict the soft actuatorâ€™s body posture changes, such as bending, twisting and stretching. Plus, the model can discern contact events with or without thermal stimuli. This data-driven method for multi-modal sensing discrimination might pave the way for future intelligent soft robots.
